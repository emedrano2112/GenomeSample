# GenomeSample
Instructions:
To run this tests, you will maybe need to download the ChromeDriver latest release (2.41)(http://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads). 
Then once you have checked out the project into your environment, within the "SearchBottleTC" file, line 20; feel free to pass the path
where the ChromeDriver is located to the "exePath" variable.

Once done, all needed for the tests to run is browse the project's folder within your machine and type in (in the terminal) "mvn clean test".

Best,
Emanuel.
